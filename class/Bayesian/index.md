## Class notes and Hands-on

This is an attempt to organize and make available to any student the class notes used during this course. The material is a compilation of texts, examples, and materials from multiple books and papers that we visited to create the classes. We suggest using it as a guide for lessons. *Important: these class notes do not replace the fundamental role of the textbooks !!* At the end of each topic, there are references. We suggest that you visit the references for a complete understanding.
