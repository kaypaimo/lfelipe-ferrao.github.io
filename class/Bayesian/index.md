## Course Description

This talk aims to be a friendly introduction to Bayesian analysis. Whenever we introduce new concepts, we keep the mathematics to a minimum and focus instead on the intuition behind the thory. 
We do not assume any prior knowledge of probability (which is central to Bayesian analysis) or calculus. Nor do we advocate Bayesian versus frequentist schools. The idea here is to provide the first contact with this topic and, hopefully, 
motivate students to use this tool for practical analyzes at the interface of genetics and plant breeding.
