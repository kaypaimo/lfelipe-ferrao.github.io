## Course Description

This talk aims to be a friendly introduction to Bayesian analysis. Whenever we introduce new concepts, we keep the mathematics to a minimum and focus instead on the intuition behind the theory. For this class, we also do not assume any prior knowledge of probability (which is central to Bayesian analysis) or calculus. Nor do we advocate in favor of Bayesian analysis, instead of the frequentist school. The idea here is to provide an introduction on this topic and, hopefully, motivate students in genetics and plant breeding to use this tool for practical analyzes.

## Class notes and Hands-on

This is an attempt to organize and make available to any student the class notes used during this course. The material is a compilation of texts, examples, and materials from multiple books and papers that we visited to create the classes. We suggest using it as a guide for lessons. *Important: these class notes do not replace the fundamental role of the textbooks !!* At the end of each topic, there are references. We suggest that you visit the references for a complete understanding.
