## Course Description

This talk aims to be a friendly introduction to Bayesian analysis. Whenever we introduce new concepts, we keep the mathematics to a minimum and focus instead on the intuition behind the theory. 
For this class, we also do not assume any prior knowledge of probability (which is central to Bayesian analysis) or calculus. Nor do we advocate in favor of Bayesian analysis, instead of the frequentist school. The idea here is to provide an introduction on this topic and, hopefully, 
motivate students in genetics and plant breeding to use this tool for practical analyzes.
