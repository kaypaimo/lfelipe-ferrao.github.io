## Course Description

Advanced training in quantitative genetics is critical for success of the modern breeder. This course addresses this need both from a theoretical and applied perspective. PCB 6555 Introduction to
Quantitative Genetics will be based on lectures and hands-on activities that utilize the content learned in class. The course is intended for students of all disciplines who are interested in quantitative genetic
principles and biometric evaluation of characters that exhibit continuous variation in natural populations and breeding programs for animals and/or plants.

## Course Objectives
The course goal is to introduce graduate students to concepts, theory and methods in quantitative
genetics with emphasis in application to breeding programs and statistical analysis of genetic
experiments/studies.
