Hello.

My name is Luis Felipe Ventorim Ferrão and I'm a research Assistant Scientist at the University of Florida, working under Patricio Munoz  supervision in the [Blueberry Breeding and Genomics Lab](https://www.blueberrybreeding.com/). 

I obtained my Ph.D. in Genetics and Plant Breeding at the University of São Paulo (ESALQ,USP), Brazil. I am currently interested in statistical genetics, mixed models, Bayesian approaches and quantitative genetics of polyploids. You can read more about my work on this webpage and also see codes, papers and talks associated with my research.

## Some research topics:

* Genetic mapping: statistical methods and the software
  [_OneMap_](http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/onemap/index.html)
* QTL Mapping
* Association Mapping
* G x E interaction
* Genomic Selection
* Genetic of Polyploids
